Nanoservices framework

It is in development by now, a more meaningful readme will be added later

How to build
------------

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dmerkushov/nanoservices.git`
cd nanoservices/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
make
cd ../..
```

After a successful build and all the tests passing the resulting shared object will be `nanoservices/build/ns-skeleton/libns-skeleton.so`

Header files to include to use the library will be in `nanoservices/ns-skeleton/include/`
